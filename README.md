# 💜 PhonePe Pulse: FinTech Operational Analytics Dashboard



## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive Business Intelligence solution analyzing ₹3.3B+ in digital transactions. Inspired by PhonePe's Pulse data, I designed a multi-page interactive application to track success rates, service-wise performance, and transaction failure root causes.

### 🛠️ Technical Stack
- **Visualization:** Power BI Desktop
- **UI/UX Design:** Figma (Custom Side-Navigation & Icons)
- **Data Engine:** Power Query (M Language) & DAX
- **Logic:** Advanced (Time-Series Forecasting & Operational KPIs)

## 📊 Business Insights (KPIs)
- **Total Transaction Value:** ₹3.33B+
- **Total Transactions:** 300K
- **Successful Transactions:** 288K (96% Success Rate)
- **Failed Transactions:** 12K (Deep-dive analysis into user vs. system errors)

## 📱 Multi-Page Navigation
The dashboard features an app-like sidebar navigation built in Figma, allowing users to switch between:
1. **Overview:** High-level performance trends.
2. **Insurance:** Analyzing premiums and claim patterns.
3. **Loans:** Tracking loan amounts and approval trends.
4. **Money Transfer:** Visualizing peer-to-peer transaction flows.
5. **Recharge & Bills:** Consumer behavior in utility payments.

## 🔍 Failure Root Cause Analysis
I implemented a specialized "Failure Reason" chart to help technical operations teams identify:
- **System Errors:** Server issues & Bank denials (34%+).
- **User Errors:** Wrong PIN & Insufficient funds.
